      "I have a question for Mr. McGee that has to do with gambling.  Do you think it's wise to immediately play all of your high cards at the beginning of a deal in an attempt to intimidate the other players in hopes that they will drop out, or should a person hold their high cards until the stakes become really high?  To me, it seems wiser to hold the high cards but I played a game with two men once who played everything they had right away to try to make me feel as if I had no chance.  They really gloated and thought themselves to be great players.  In the end, I was able to wipe the table clean.  Which do you think is the wiser?  Thanks!\n",

What a lot of people don't know is that Fez comes from a group of citizens who lived during biblical times, the Fezonites.  They were a group of nomads who roamed the desert making and selling their hats (Fez's) for a living.  It wasn't until Theodore Roosevelt was President that they officially named the hat a Fez.  The Fezonites were ban from the desert because they followed the Israelites around and that ticked them off, and with their taller than normal hats they could catch more manna when it fell, so Moses told them to get lost; I guess he had talked to God about it or something and God told Moses to ditch'em, so they did.  To get even with the Israelites, the Fezonites began showing up at funeral homes wearing their special hats (Fez) along with aprons and holding some sort of service for the deceased.  No one actually knows if this service was a part of their community or something they just made up for fun & to be annoying.  Eventually they expanded their operations and incorporated pancake breakfasts and riding in smaller than normal cars, driving in zig-zag patterns thus snarling traffic.  Then along came Teddy Roosevelt and he passed a law that they could only zig-zag during parades and he added the ceremonial tossing of the tootsie roll.

What a lot of people don't know is that Fez comes from a group of citizens who lived during biblical times, the Fezonites.  They were a group of nomad-esque folk who roamed the desert making and selling their hats (Fez's) for a living. (it wasn't until Theodore Roosevelt was President that they officially named the hat a Fez), and they did make a fairly good living. The men making the hats, the women standing outside of the tents yelling to travelers that their fez was for sale.  The Fezonites were ban from the desert because they followed the Israelites around and that ticked the Israelites off, also the Fezonites with their taller than normal hats could catch more manna when it fell, so Moses told them to get lost; I guess he had talked to God about it or something and God told Moses to ditch'em, so they did since the whole desert traking scene was about the Israelites to begin with.  To get even with the Israelites, the Fezonites began showing up at funeral homes wearing their special hats (Fez) along with aprons and holding some sort of service for the deceased Isreali.  No one actually knows if this service was a part of the Fezonites' rituals or just something they made up for fun & to be annoying.  Eventually they expanded their operations and incorporated pancake breakfasts and riding in smaller than normal cars, driving in serpentine patterns, thus snarling traffic, of course this was much later in history because they didn't have maple syrup in biblical times, everyone knows that plus it's really hard to get a camel to serpentine. So much later, along came Teddy Roosevelt and he passed a law that they could only serpentine during parades and he added the ceremonial tossing of the tootsie roll to suffice.  Their Hebrew name was Fezonite, which translates into Shriner.  In tracking their migratory progress you can see how some came to the United States and settled in Ohio, the rest of the them fled to Poland.  Now you know the rest of the story.\n",

How many people while trying to earn their living, would care to be tipped in the process?  I'd wager to guess not many.  It is also extremely dangerous as we use to have a whore who sat on the corner of our church yard waiting for her chance to increase her daily earnings.  We also used a lawn service that sprayed the yard regularly.  The grass in the spot where the whore sat was dead.  Whatever she had was stronger than the chemicals the lawn service used.  So if one must partake in this distasteful practice of tipping whores, I certainly hope you will use industrial strength body protection.  Apparently, gone are the days of cows or outhouse tipping and now the youngsters tip whores.  Tsk,Tsk,Tsk...\n",
